## 🐕 Introduction
<p align="justify"> 
Completely free, Retriever.io is a Open Source GUI that works as a frontend for yt-dlp, with a focus on making it easier to use for users with no programming experience.
</p>

Built in `Tauri` and using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) in the back-end (core functionalities), the app is capable of:
- Download videos from many websites, check the [supported websites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md);
- Select a specific file extension;
- Trim the file;
- Download multiples files at once;
- 🚧(coming soon!) Edit multiple videos/audios at once🚧;
